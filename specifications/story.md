# Story

First: basic info about CodecoolClass: location, year, mentors + U?

Mentor checks energy and mood level.

Mentor acts in regard of the mood and energy level: check mood, and check energy level (This means, that the mentor can increase energy level, and cheer up students)

Coding session is starting: ask_for_help(), teach() get_worked_on()

Creepy Guy arrives. He does his stuff (increase mentors teaching level)

Coffeemachine + EKI (=energy knowledge influence)

Coffeemachine goes wrong, students can't energised -> BJ (Boda JÃ³zsi) increases
EVERTHING (except stress level)

Feedback (Mentors give students feedback)

+ other fun parts that we figure out during work
